1. Introduction
    --> Develop by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems at 1995
    --> Usage: Web, Mobile, Desktop, Game, Distributed Processing

1.a) Features of Java:
    --> Robust: provide good exception handling framework out of the box
    --> Secured: Remove pointers from java which leads to memory leaks
    --> Multi-Threading: you can can run multiple tasks paralleled using multi-Threading
    --> Garbage Collector: provide GC which will auto remove/delete unused params from program
    --> Object-Oriented: everything in java runs around Java
    --> Platform Independent: Byte code will runs anywhere (e.g. Linux/Window/Mac)
    --> Strong type-checking: force you to respect the contract of the variables to the data-types.  
    --> compile & interpret

1.b) Anatomy of Java:
    JDK
        JRE
            JVM
            Class Libraries
            Other Libraries
