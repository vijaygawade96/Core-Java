1. Introduction
    --> Develop by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems at 1995
    --> Usage: Web, Mobile, Desktop, Game, Distributed Processing

1.a) Features of Java:
    --> Robust: provide good exception handling framework out of the box
    --> Secured: Remove pointers from java which leads to memory leaks
    --> Multi-Threading: you can can run multiple tasks paralleled using multi-Threading
    --> Garbage Collector: provide GC which will auto remove/delete unused params from program
    --> Object-Oriented: everything in java runs around Java
    --> Platform Independent: Byte code will runs anywhere (e.g. Linux/Window/Mac)
    --> Strong type-checking: force you to respect the contract of the variables to the data-types.  
    --> compile & interpret

1.b) Anatomy of Java:
    JDK
        JRE
            JVM
            Class Libraries
            Other Libraries

2.a) Primitive Data Types
    char: 
        -> single 16-bit Unicode character
        -> size 2 bytes
        -> Range: '\u0000' (or 0) to a maximum value of '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive)

    byte:
        -> 8-bit signed two's complement integer
        -> Range: -128 to 127 (inclusive)

    short:
        -> 16-bit signed two's complement integer
        -> Range: -32,768 to 32,767 (inclusive)

    int:
        -> 32-bit signed two's complement integer
        -> Range:  -2^31 to 2^31 -1

    long:
        -> 64-bit two's complement integer
        -> -2^63 and a maximum value of 2^63 -1

    float:
        -> a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point
        -> Range: 0.000000 to 340282346638528860000000000000000000000.000000

    double:
        -> a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point
        -> Range: 0.000000 to 179769313486231570000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.000000

    boolean:
        ->  only two possible values: true and false
